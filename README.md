## Reflection and Approach

The context of the project is a for lenders to build, launch and scale their lending business across multiple channels at a faster rate to market at a fraction of the cost independent building efforts. For lenders to be connected to the best payments, data and service providers.

- I adopted the use of the Vite frontend tool in order to make development more convenient.
- I made use of mixins in SASS to store variables and reusable style rules to ease the complexity of styling.
- I installed the axios library for the use of making requests to the API
